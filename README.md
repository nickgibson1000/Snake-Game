# Snake Game

## **Overview**
A simple implementation of the game Snake in C. It utilizes ncurses as a TUI (Text-User Interface) for realtime game updates.

## **Installation & Setup**
**NOTICE: This project was developed and tested on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). The following instructions are tailored for this environment but should work on most Linux distrobutions.**

**Windows: If using windows, I highly recommend setting up WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run this project. WSL is a lightweight Linux enviroment within windows, utilizing the Ubuntu distrobution, makeing it easier to install and use tools like ncurses.

To get started follow the steps below:

1. **Install ncurses**
```sh
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```
